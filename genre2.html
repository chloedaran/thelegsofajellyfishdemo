		<h2>The Highlight Albums:</h2>
		<img src = "images/atlanta.jpeg" alt = "atlanta" width="200"/>
		<h3>Atlanta Millionaires Club by Faye Webster</h3>
		<h4>Rating: 8.9/10; Genre: Indie Folk, Folk Pop, Alternative Country</h4>
		<p>
			Faye Webster is a unique artist that essentially creates her own genre of music. She possesses a country tune over 
			a folk and indie rock sound. Her lyrics channel moods of longing in a relationship sense but in a modern/relatable matter
			that allows listeners to swoon and sway to her beat. My favorite songs the album are "Kingston," "Room Temperature," "Right Sice of My Neck,"
			and "Jonny."

		<h3>Bloom by Beach House</h3>
		<h4>Rating: 10/10; Genre: Dream Pop, Indie Rock, Shoe Gaze </h4>
		<p>
			This is my favorite album of all time. Each song of this album beautifully dances with eachother, creating a distinguished album as a whole.
			Bloom precipitates a build up and release of emotions that allows listener to transcend from their environment to a different realm. 
			The lyrics create a soft lullaby that supports the array of instruments. The crescendo and collapse of the sound creates
			an oscillation that purges listeners of their coveted inner feelings. The sound surrounds you. My favorite songs off of the albumn are 
			"Myth," "Other People," "The Hours," "Wild," and "Troublemaker."

		<h3>Let the Sun Talk by Mavi</h3>
		<h4>Rating: 9.0/10; Genre: Hip Hop, Progressive Rap</h4>
		<p>
			This album is entirely unique and demonstrates skilled poetic talent. Mavi is a new artist that 
			produces beautifully crafted lyrical flow about themes of social injustice in the United States. He touches on themes 
			of race, gender inequality, and poverty. With this album Mavi not only produces an exquisite sound but he also tells a story 
			of his experience as a Black man facing struggles in America.
		    My favorite songs off of the album are "Self Love," "Daylight Savings," "Love, of Money,"
			and "Guernica."
