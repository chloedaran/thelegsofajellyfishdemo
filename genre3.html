        <p> If you are searching for a song that lies at the intersection of dream pop and indie rock,
            you should check out the song "D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L" by the artist Panchiko. This song possesses
            a dreamy, ethereal quality that allows a listener to reimagine their environment around them to 
            the scene of a movie.

        <h3>"Walking the Cow" by Daniel Johnston </h3>
        <p> If you are searching for a song that provides a calming aura, check out the song "Walking the Cow" by Daniel Johnston.
            This song provides an almost whiny vintage sound that makes you feel like a 
            Napolean Dynamite character.

        <h3> "Cut Me" by Moses Sumney </h3>
        <p> This song is brilliant in its vocal range and instrumentation. Moses possesses a unique 
            sound that is soulful and deep. This song feels warm and goosebumps your skin with the 
            distincive audio arena it creates.

        <img src = "images/haram.jpeg" alt = "haram" width="200"/>
        <h3> "Falling out of the Sky" by Armand Hammer</h3>
        <p> This song comes from the album Haram, which caused a large shock factor in the music community due to
            the album cover being quite explicit. The album cover featues two bloody pig heads, which is relevant to
            the title of this hip hop album being called "Haram." The song itself has a unique lyrical flow 
            that forces listeners to bop their heads. Backing up the skillful rap flow, the song is supported by 
            ineteresting audio samples that enhance the experience of listening to the song.

        <h3>"Center of Gravity" by Yo La Tengo</h3>
        <p> This song features a long of distinct instrumentation that transports you to summer nights
            watching a live band perform at a local sea-side restaurant. The soft voices lullaby listeners
            to sway to the loving and warm beat. 
        </p>

        <h3>"Life Worth Missing" by Car Seat Headrest</h3>
        <p> This song is an indie rock feature that channels a listener to feel like the main character in 
            a coming of age film. This song in my opinion is a song to air scream to while you put your headphones
            on full volume.

        <h3>"Platinum Tears" by Baby Father</h3>
        <p> If you want to either impress or shock your friends, play this beat in front of them. "Platinum Tears"
            is a british rap song that has impressive lyrical flow. The most defining feature of this song is that 
            it sounds like an artist rapping in a british accent.

        <h3>"Blue Motel Room" by Joni Mitchell</h3>
        <p> This somber song cradles listeners while Joni softly whimpers about blues. The song provides
            a comforting mood that cushions listers while they dissociate in a blues mood. 
        </p>

            along to the adolescent punk sound of Car Seat Headrest.
